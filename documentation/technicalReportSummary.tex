The inherent limitation in resolving the vertical fish distribution from 2-D images is overcome by utilizing a unique frequency dependence in acoustic scattering from fish. Air-filled swim bladder inside a fish is a strong acoustic scatterer, where its' frequency response resembles that of a damped-harmonic oscillator. This frequency response is sensitive and nonlinearly related to fish occupancy depth, which enables estimation of their vertical distribution using multi-frequency images.}

% \subsection{Extendend Kalman Filter for Accounting Acoustic Attenuation Caused by Dense Fish Shoals}
\subsection{Extendend Kalman Filter for Number Density and Depth Distribution Estimation of Dense Fish Groups}
An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is designed to estimate the number density and depth distribution of a dense fish group.
% An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is designed to account for acoustic attenuation caused by dense fish shoals. 
When a fish group is sufficiently dense and the acoustic transmission frequency is near the resonance frequency of fish swim bladder scattering, acoustic wave significantly attenuates as it further propagates through the dense fish shoal. 
This attenuation is caused by a number of factors including fish depth distribution, amount of air inside their swim bladder, number density, and acoustic transmission frequency.
In such cases, it is desirable to compensate for the accumulated attenuation since the total population can be under-estimated.
The presented EKF accounts for acoustic attenuation and simultaneously estimates number density and physical parameters that describe the vertical distribution of a fish group.

State of a fish shoal is expressed as an unknown state vector that consists of 7 parameters about a group as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stateVec}
\mathbf{x} = \left[z_1, H_1, z_2, H_2, r, z_\text{nb}, n_\text{AdB}\right]^{T},
\end{equation}

\noindent where, $z_1$ and $z_2$ are respectively the mean shoal depths of a fish shoal that has two layers vertically. 
$H_1$ and $H_2$ are respectively the vertical thickness of each fish layer and $r$ represents the fractional population of the first fish layer with mean depth $z_1$ and vertical thickness $H_1$.
$z_\text{nb}$ and $n_\text{A,dB}$ are respectively the neutral buoyancy depth and areal number density of this fish shoal.
For the region within the shoal that is closest to the acoustic source, the measurements are not attenuated. 
Within this shoal region, raw scattering strength measurements can be used to infer the and initialize the shoal state vector.
At a consecutive range step that is further into the shoal with respect to the acoustic source, the fish shoal state continuously transitions with attenuated measurements.
Shoal state at each range step can be estimated using an EKF where the shoal state transition and measurement models are 

\begin{align}
\label{eq:model}
\mathbf{x}_k = & \mathbf{x}_{k-1} + \mathbf{w}_k \\ \nonumber
\mathbf{z}_k = & \mathbf{h}\left(\mathbf{x}_k\right) + \mathbf{v}_k.
\end{align}

\noindent $\mathbf{x}_k$ and $\mathbf{z}_k$ are respectively the state and measurement at the $k^\text{th}$ discrete step.
$\mathbf{w}_k$ and $\mathbf{v}_k$ are respectively the process noise and measurement noise that are assumed to follow zero-mean multivariate normal distributions with respective covariance matrices $\boldsymbol{Q}_k$ and $\boldsymbol{R}_k$.
$\mathbf{h}\left(\mathbf{x}_k\right)$ is a nonlinear measurement model as a function of the state vector $\mathbf{x}_k$ given as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:modelMeasureVector}
\mathbf{h}\left(\mathbf{x}_k\right) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
h\left(\mathbf{x}_k;f_1\right) & h\left(\mathbf{x}_k;f_2\right) & \dots & h\left(\mathbf{x}_k;f_{N_f}\right)
\end{bmatrix}^T,
\end{equation}

\noindent where $h\left(\mathbf{x}_k;f_i\right)$ is the measurement model at the $i^\text{th}$ transmission frequency among $N_f$ discrete frequency bandwidths.
$h\left(\mathbf{x}_k;f_i\right)$ is expressed as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:modelMeasureMember}
h\left(\mathbf{x}_k;f_i\right) = \overline{\text{TS}}\left(z_1, H_1, z_2, H_2, r, z_\text{nb}\right) + n_\text{AdB},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\overline{\text{TS}}\left(z_1, H_1, z_2, H_2, r, z_\text{nb}\right)$ is the mean Target Strength (TS) of a swim bladder bearing fish using the Love model with the current state parameters $\mathbf{x}_k$ of the fish shoal.
Note that the measurement model $h\left(\mathbf{x}_k;f_i\right)$ does not include attenuation, and accordingly the measurement $\mathbf{z}_k$ denotes the attenuation corrected measurement.
This attenuation correction can be done based on the history of the estimated state vectors up to $k-1$ range step. 
Attenuation factor at each range step calculated using the state estimate at the corresponding range step is accumulated over the range up to the $k-1$ range.
Raw measurement at $k$ range step is then scaled up by this accumulated attenuation.

Prediction step of the current EKF is given as

\begin{align}
\label{eq:prediction}
\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k-1} = & \hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k-1|k-1} \\ \nonumber
\boldsymbol{P}_{k|k-1} = & \boldsymbol{P}_{k-1|k-1} + \boldsymbol{Q}_k,
\end{align}

\noindent where $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k-1}$ and $\boldsymbol{P}_{k|k-1}$ are the state estimate and error covariance matrix at range step $k$ given the measurements up to range step $k-1$.

The state estimate and error covariance matrix are updated by

\begin{align}
\label{eq:update}
\tilde{\mathbf{y}}_{k} = & \mathbf{z}_k - \hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k-1} \\ \nonumber
\boldsymbol{S}_k = & \boldsymbol{H}_k \boldsymbol{P}_{k|k-1} \boldsymbol{H}_k^T
+ \boldsymbol{R}_k \\ \nonumber
\boldsymbol{K}_k = & \boldsymbol{P}_{k|k-1} \boldsymbol{H}_k^T \boldsymbol{S}_k^{-1} \\ \nonumber
\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k} = & \hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k-1} + \boldsymbol{K}_k \tilde{\mathbf{y}}_{k} \\ \nonumber
\boldsymbol{P}_{k|k} = & \left(\boldsymbol{I} - \boldsymbol{K}_k \boldsymbol{H}_k \right)\boldsymbol{P}_{k|k-1},
\end{align}

\noindent where $\tilde{\mathbf{y}}_{k}$ is the measurement residual, $\boldsymbol{S}_k$ is the covariance of the residual and $\boldsymbol{K}_k$ is the Kalman gain.
$\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k}$ and $\boldsymbol{P}_{k|k}$ are the updated state estimate and estimate covariance.
$\boldsymbol{H}_k$ is a Jacobian matrix of the measurement model evalated at the predicted state $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k-1}$ given as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:jacobian}
\boldsymbol{H}_k = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial h(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k-1};f_1)}{\partial z_1}
& \frac{\partial h(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k-1};f_1)}{\partial H_1}
& \frac{\partial h(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k-1};f_1)}{\partial z_2}
& \frac{\partial h(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k-1};f_1)}{\partial H_2}
& \frac{\partial h(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k-1};f_1)}{\partial r}
& \frac{\partial h(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k-1};f_1)}{\partial z_\text{nb}}
& 1 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial h(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k-1};f_{N_f})}{\partial z_1}
& \frac{\partial h(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k-1};f_{N_f})}{\partial H_1}
& \frac{\partial h(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k-1};f_{N_f})}{\partial z_2}
& \frac{\partial h(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k-1};f_{N_f})}{\partial H_2}
& \frac{\partial h(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k-1};f_{N_f})}{\partial r}
& \frac{\partial h(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k-1};f_{N_f})}{\partial z_\text{nb}}
& 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

\noindent The above scheme is for a single measurement at each range step, however, this scheme can be easily extended for multiple measurements by concatenating multiple measurements and measurement models.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Fish Shoal State Estimation Accounting for Attenuation using the Extended Kalman Filter}
Here, the EKF is used to estimate fish shoal state when attenuation caused by the fish shoal is present in the measurements.
First, a synthetic scattering strength is tested to validate the current EKF model.
Scattering strength from a fish shoal of 5 km horizontal thickness with two vertical layers is modeled as shown below.


\begin{figure}[htp!]
  \centering
  {\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{{./figs/syntheticConfiguration20180515}.eps}}
  \caption{Range-depth configuration of the fish shoal}
  \label{fig:configSynthetic}
\end{figure}

\noindent Neutral buoyancy of the fish shoal is assumed to be 10 m below the sea surface and each vertical layer includes equal fish population.
Areal fish number density along the range within the fish shoal is assumed as shown in Figure \ref{fig:naSynthetic}. The maximum areal number density is approximately 3 fish/m$^2$ at 2.5 km range.

\begin{figure}[htp!]
  \centering
  {\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{{./figs/nASynthetic20180515}.eps}}
  \caption{Synthetic areal number density through the fish shoal}
  \label{fig:naSynthetic}
\end{figure}

\noindent Synthetic Scattering Strength (SS) from this fish shoal is shown in Figures \ref{fig:ssSyntheticWithNoise} and \ref{fig:ssSyntheticWithoutNoise}, where Figure \ref{fig:ssSyntheticWithNoise} includes a zero-mean Gaussian white noise with 3 dB standard deviation and Figure \ref{fig:ssSyntheticWithoutNoise} shows the SS without any noise.
SS at 1465 Hz and 1600 Hz are strong at close ranges but also shows the most attenuation as shown in the in Figure \ref{fig:ssSyntheticWithoutNoise} because the resonance scattering frequency is near 1500 Hz as shown in \ref{fig:tsSynthetic}.

  \caption{Synthetic Scattering Strength (SS) through the fish shoal without noise}

\end{figure}

% \noindent SS at 850 and 1465 Hz are strongest at close ranges but also shows the most attenuation as shown in the Target Strength curve in Figure \ref{fig:tsSynthetic}.

\begin{figure}[htp!]

  {\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{{./figs/tsSynthetic20180515}.eps}}
  \caption{Synthetic Target Strength (TS) at the front and end of the shoal}
  \label{fig:tsSynthetic}
\end{figure}

EKF is applied to this synthetic SS data where 10 measurements at each range step are used to predict and update the fish shoal state. 
The measurement noise covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{Q}_k$ is a diagonal matrix since each measurement is assumed uncorrelated and noise at each frequency is assumed to be uncorrelated. 
Small random perturbation is included in $\boldsymbol{Q}_k$ to resolve a singularity issue caused when multiple measurements following an identical distribution is used.
The process noise covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{R}_k$ is also a diagonal matrix since each state parameter is assumed uncorrelated to each other.


First, the EKF model shows the state estimate using data without any noise.
The state estimate is shown in Figures \ref{fig:ekfEstimationWithoutNoise1} and \ref{fig:ekfEstimationWithoutNoise2}.
In general, the estimation is better at closer range steps and deviates from the ground truth as the range steps increases.
Figure \ref{fig:ekfEstimationWithoutNoise1} shows the EKF estimation of the fish shoal vertical distribution.
Mean occupancy depth estimation of the upper and lower fish layers shown in Figure \ref{fig:ekfEstimationWithoutNoise1} (a) and (c) respectively show errors from the ground truth mean occupancy depths to within 4 \% and 20 \% with respect to their ground truth vertical thicknesses.
Shoal vertical thickness estimation of the upper and lower fish layers shown in Figure \ref{fig:ekfEstimationWithoutNoise1} (b) and (d) respectively show errors from the ground truth vertical thicknesses to within 8 \% and 30 \% with respect to their ground truth vertical thicknesses.
EKF estimation of the fractional population of the upper fish layer, neutral buouancy depth and areal number density are accurate to be within 1\% error with respect to their ground truth values.

% \subsection{Temporal evolution of the frequency response of Coalescing Herring shoals}
% Multiple herring shoals coalesced during the night of Februrary 20th, 2014  over a 1.5 hour time period from 22:10:00 to 23:20:00 UTC in the northwest region of the trench near Alesund. 
% Bathymetry of this region is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:bathymetry}.

% \begin{figure}[htp!]

%   Bathymetry near the northwest region of the trench near Alesund, Norway.
%   }
%   \label{fig:bathymetry}
% \end{figure}


% At the beginning of the track, near 22:00:00, RV Knorr heads southwest and the shoals distributed in the southeastern region of the ship starts to coalesce. 
% The ship slowly turns it’s heading to south while the coalescing shoals on the left to the ship heading are monitored throughout the track. The shoals coalesce towards the northern flank of the bank where the water depth gradually changes from 120 m to 100 m.
% Resonant acoustic scattering frequency of these multiple coalescing shoals is found to be between 850 Hz and 955 Hz during the migration, then shifts towards 1125 Hz after the shoals merge into a larger single shoal.
% After the shoals merge into a larger shoal, frequency response of the dense shoal region peaks at 955 Hz, whereas that of the diffuse shoal region peaks at 1125 Hz. 
% This implies the fish in the dense shoal region occupies a shallower water depth than those in the diffuse shoal region given a constant neutral buoyancy depth.

% Temporal evolution of the frequency response of multiple coalescing shoals is analyzed. 
% the shoal boundary indicated by the black contour lines is determined by scaling down the Herring shoal critical density found in the Gulf of Maine, 0.2 fish/m$^2$, by the body length ratio squared, and using a calibrated mean Target Strength (TS) at 955 Hz ($\overline{\text{TS}}_\text{955 Hz} = -30 $ dB re 1 m$^2$) near this region.
% The magenta contour lines indicate the dense shoal region where the SS levels are 6 dB higher than that of the black contour lines.
% To reduce the variance, pings within 5 minute time window are averaged at each frequency. At 955 Hz, 6 consecutive pings are available within the 5 minute time window, whereas at the other frequencies, 850, 1125, 1335, 1465 and 1600 Hz, 2 consecutive pings are available. 
% % Figure 1(b), (c) and (d) show the Scattering Strength (SS) maps at 955 Hz at the three time windows chosen for the analysis. 
% Figs. \ref{fig:evolutionShoal1}, \ref{fig:evolutionShoal2}, \ref{fig:evolutionShoal3} and \ref{fig:evolutionShoal4} show the frequency response evolution over time before they form a large shoal (roughly, 22:10:00 to 23:10:00 UTC).
% Portion of the shoal shown in Fig. \ref{fig:evolutionShoal1}(a) migrates towards south, merging with other shoals to form a larger shoal.
% The other portion of this shoal splits into small schools and scatter, moving roughly towards the northeast direction.
% Peak of the frequency response of this shoal gradually changes from near 955 Hz to 1125 Hz as this shoal migrates southwards.
% % When the ship turns, the SS levels are not stable because the receiver array does not remain straight. 
% % Pings during the time windows within which the ship is not turning or zigzagging are used for the frequency response analysis. 
% Another shoal that is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:evolutionShoal2} starts to form at around 22:20:00 UTC.
% This shoal develops over roughly an hour period and merges with other shoals to form a single large shoal.
% During this shoal formation and colaescence, peak of the frequency response gradually changes from near 955 Hz to 1125 Hz.
% The shoal in Fig. \ref{fig:evolutionShoal3} shows a similar frequency response evolution with the shoals in Figs. \ref{fig:evolutionShoal1} and \ref{fig:evolutionShoal2} over the same time period.
% As this shoal develops and merges with other shoals, peak of the frequency response gradually changes from near 955 Hz to 1125 Hz. 
% Coalescence of the largest migrating shoal is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:evolutionShoal4}.
% This shoal migrates southwest towards the northern tip of the bank.
% During the migration, peak of the frequency response remains stable near and below 955 Hz.
% Fig. \ref{fig:evolutionShoalMerged} shows the frequency response after the 4 shoals (either formed or migrated) merged together.
% The resonant peak frequency is near 1125 Hz, where the peak is more apparent for the diffuse region of the shoal.
% For the denser region of the shoal, the resonance peak frequency is below 1125 Hz. 
% This implies that the fish in the dense shoal region occupies a shallower water depth than those in the diffuse shoal region.

% % Figure 2(a) and (b) show the frequency responses when the shoal is migrating and Figure 2(c) shows the frequency response when the shoal is relatively stationary near the northern flank of the bank. The black solid lines indicate the frequency responses of the entire shoal within the black contours of the SS maps in Figure 1. The magenta solid lines show the frequency responses of the dense shoal region within the magenta contours of the SS maps and the blue solid lines show the frequency responses of the diffuse shoal region between the black and magenta contours of the SS maps.
% % In Figure 2(a), showing the frequency response when the shoal starts to migrate, the resonance frequency is below or near 850 Hz and the frequency response patterns of the dense and diffuse shoal region are similar. In Figure 2(b), the shoal migrates towards the northern flank of the bank and shows the resonance frequency shift towards 955 Hz. The resonance peak at 955 Hz is sharper in the dense shoal region than that in the diffuse shoal region. In Figure 2(c), the shoal arrives at the northern flank of the bank and remains relatively stationary. The resonance frequency shifts to 1125 Hz for the entire shoal, however the resonance frequencies of the dense and diffuse shoal regions are different. While the resonance frequency of the dense shoal region is 955 Hz, that of the diffuse shoal region is 1125 Hz. Given a constant neutral buoyancy depth, this implies the fish in the dense shoal region occupies a shallower water depth than those in the diffuse shoal region.
