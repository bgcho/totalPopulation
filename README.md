## Extended Kalman filter (EKF) implementation for accurate total fish population estimation using multi-frequency acoustic intensity images

1. The EKF method is implemented in MATLAB and is used for number density and vertical distribution estimation of a fish group using multi-frequency acoustic intensity images.
2. The example code is used to verify if the EKF method performs well in estimating number density and vertical distribution of a fish group. For this verification, A set of synthetic multi-frequency scattered return data is used.
3. Run sourceCode/EKFtest.m
4. Details of the EKF method and the specific parameter values that are used in the example is described in documentation/technicalReportSummary.pdf
